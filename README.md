# ROCK-PAPER-SCISSOR-GAME
📌 Overview
This project is a console-based Rock-Paper-Scissors game built using C++, designed for an interactive and engaging experience. It allows the user to play against a computer opponent, with results determined based on the classic rules of the game:

Rock beats Scissors

Scissors beats Paper

Paper beats Rock

The computer’s moves are randomized to ensure unpredictability, and the program includes input validation to handle unexpected user entries gracefully.

🔧 Features
User Input Validation: Ensures only valid choices (rock, paper, scissors) are accepted, prompting the user to re-enter if needed.

Randomized Computer Moves: Uses C++'s rand() function to generate unpredictable computer choices each round.

Game Logic Implementation: Determines whether the user wins, loses, or ties based on traditional Rock-Paper-Scissors rules.

Personalized Result Messages: Each outcome is accompanied by a custom message for a more immersive experience.

Replay Option: Offers the user the option to play again or exit the game after each round.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Programming Language: C++

IDE/Compiler: Any standard C++ compiler like GCC, Visual Studio, or Code::Blocks

Standard Library: <iostream>, <cstdlib>, and <ctime> for input/output, randomness, and time-based seeding

🎉 How to Play
The game prompts you to enter your move (rock, paper, or scissors).

The computer generates its move randomly.

The game determines the winner based on the moves and displays the outcome.

You'll get a chance to play again or exit after each round.

🏅 Example Output
bash
Copy
Edit
Welcome to Rock-Paper-Scissors!

Enter your move (rock/paper/scissors): rock
Computer chose: scissors  
You win! 🎉

Play again? (y/n): y
💡 Future Improvements (Ideas)
Score Tracker: Keep track of wins, losses, and ties across multiple rounds.

Multiplayer Mode: Allow two users to play against each other.

GUI Version: Expand to a graphical user interface using a library like SFML or Qt.

Advanced AI Opponent: Implement a more strategic computer opponent instead of random moves.
